# OTF2Fontspec

CLI tools to look up:

1. What OTF features are (not) supported by fontspec;

2. What supported an OTF feature does if you enable it;

3. What supported OTF features a font has (WIP)

## Why

1. I cannot be bothered piping commands after commands to view what features there are for a given font.

2. I don't want to have to go through `fontspec` documentation to look up what commands I need to access certain OTF features.

3. I don't want to have to look up online to get an idea of what a feature is/does. (WIP).
